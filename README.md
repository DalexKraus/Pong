# Pong
An Android 2D game derived from the original Pong (https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong)

This repository contains the entire Android Studio project,
which can be directly cloned from GitHub for free use.

The goal of this project is to learn how to write efficient programs, while maintaining a clean and solid codebase.
Furthermore, it is important to us to acquire more knowledge in the field of computer graphics,
as well as complex algorithms.

## Notes
Please keep in mind that this game is 'just' a spare time project after all.
We will try to put as much time into this project as possible,
but as we are all still attending school, it may turn out rather difficult for us to make progress.
